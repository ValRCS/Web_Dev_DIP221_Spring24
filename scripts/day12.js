//let's explore Javascript functions
//functions are a way to group code together

//let's make a simple greeting that prints something fixed to console
function greet() {
    //so we have a way of grouping code together
    console.log("Hello there!");
    console.log("I hope you are having a great day!");
    //we can add as much code as we want here
    //still functions should be kept small and do one thing and do it well - this is a good practice
    //generally if your function is over one page long you should consider breaking it up
}

//in order to use a function I need to call it
greet();
// //I could call this function as many times as I want
// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//     greet();
// }
